# Provenance parser: rdt to REPRODUCE-ME ontology

This repository contains scripts to parse the provenance output generated by the rdt package for the REPRODUCE-ME ontology, with a greater detail level.

The parser is under development and it is already available as an R package.

# Installing

Currently **rdt2repr** can be installed from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mmondelli/rdt2repr")
``` 

# Usage

Once the package has been installed, you can execute its three main functions through the Addins menu in RStudio.

Before you start using/executing your R scripts and/or commands, you can start collecting provenance data by clicking on the option: Addins > Collect provenance data
or executing the function:

``` r
rdt2repr::collectprov()
``` 

Both options will ask you to inform the full path to the directory where the provenance data will be saved. Provenance data is collected using the rdt package.

If you want to finish collecting the provenance data and save it, you can can do it by clicking on the option: Addins > Finish provenance collection
or executing the function:

``` r
rdt2repr::endprov()
``` 

Then you can convert the source in the rdt format to the reproduce-me ontology by clicking: Addins > Convert provenance format
or executing the function:

``` r
rdt2repr::endprov(rdf_file = 'output.ttl')
```

This will ask you to inform the full path to the file where the provenance data was be saved.
